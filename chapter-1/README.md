## Compiling a Rust program

`rustc <source_code>`

## Running a Rust program

`./<compiler_output>`

## Notes

- Rust file names are separated by underscore
- The `main` function is where it all begins
- Declaring a function looks like `fn main() { }`
- Calling a function followed by `!` (`println!(" ")`) means youre actually calling a macro instead
